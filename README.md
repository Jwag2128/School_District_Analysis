# School_District_Analysis
Module 4
# Overview of the School District Analysis assignment
## Our client Maria provided us with data regarding the students and schools in a district.  Our job was to combine and analyze this data in order to show the correlation between student test scores and the type of school they attend along with budget given and the size of the school.  In addition, we need to remove the 9th grade test scores from Thomas High School due to suspected academic dishonesty, then repeat the analysis.
# Results
## Our analysis was broken down into District and School level results.
•	The District Summary was only slightly affected by remove the results from Thomas High School 9th graders.  The average Math score went down by 0.01% and the Reading score stayed the same.  The percentage of students passing also only went down by 0.01% - 0.03%.
